# Touge Website 
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/BOM07kD-y6Q?si=6tUxrHXlrZNdqMbc>
#### Description:
Hello, my name is Jordan and this is my CS50x Final Project namely -- my web app called Touge. Ever since a child, I have been interested in cars, especially Japanese cars. The underground scene of the 90s and 2000s has been something I have always admired. The atmosphere it had created, the friendships and the pure skill of handling a mountain pass.

I built my app via this tech stack -- Python and Flask, Jinja, HTML5, CSS. Javascript and a bit of Javascript light frameworking - Alpine.js. And of course, SQLite3.

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Alpine.js
Backend: Python, Flask, Jinja2
Database: SQLite3
Tools: VSCode, Git, GitHub, Neovim, PyCharm

The website begins with the Home page. There, I briefly explain what Touge (å³ ) means and where it comes from. Touge is the Japanese word for mountain pass. But it can also mean a certain style of street racing in Japan which takes place on winding mountainous roads.

Let's skip the Search page for now since that is the main focus of my website. I have added a Trivia page with Javascript buttons. It displays interesting trivia about the Japanese drift and touge culture in the 90s, in the 2000s, and in modern times.
I have also added Famous Mountain Passes in Japan with pictures.

The about page briefly explains how the website came to be and what my aspirations are.

Onto the Search page. I have made a scalable and minimalistic search engine combining Flask, Jinja, Javascript, SQLite3, and HTML5. Search by manufacturer, for example "Nissan" and every car dynamically appears. Every car page consists of dynamic info that works in conjunction with my database and Jinja plus Javascript. A picture of the car, Manufacturer, Model, Year, Engine, Horsepower, Drivertrain, Induction, and trivia about the car. I have also added a Back to search for ease of access. I have built my own database with over 70 cars and over 70 images. I have also added a requirements.txt

### Future Plans

- Add user accounts and favoriting functionality.
- Introduce more interactive maps with locations of mountain passes.
- Expand car database and add advanced filtering (by year, specs, etc).
- Optimize for mobile viewing.

Thank you for CS50x and see you again!
